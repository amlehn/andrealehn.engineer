## My Journey
I am Andrea is a PhD candidate whose research integrates analytical science, solid mechanics, and environmental chemistry to investigate microplastics, which pose a serious and growing threat to the health of our planet. Through her studies in mechanical and biomedical engineering, Andrea also possesses background knowledge in fluid mechanics, heat and mass transfer, and biology.

I am passionate about applying her skills to find sustainable
solutions to the worldâ€™s biggest challenges, and is seeking job opportunities that will give me opportunities to grow as a critical thinker, expand her data science skills, and contribute to the health of people and planet.

# Work and Volunteer Experience

## Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)
### Communication Lab Fellow
May 2020 - Sep 2023 (3 years, 5 months) | Cambridge, MA
As a CommLab Fellow I served as a coach to help mechanical engineers improve  their technical communication skills. I facilitated workshops, contributed to public  facing online content, and worked with clients in one-on-one settings. Content  focused on all aspects of technical communication, such as fellowship applications, job talks, inclusive mentorship strategies, and more.

## Dow Chemical
### Research Intern
Jun 2023 - Sep 2023 (4 months) | Midland, MI
I worked on a project in Core R&D's Analytical Science capability to understand  and model geometry-dependent degradation in polyethylene subjected to = weathering. I used a combination of experimental measurements and data  science to understand degradation at the molecular scale.

## Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)
### Assistant video producer
Sep 2019 - Jun 2023 (3 years, 10 months) | Cambridge, MA
I worked with the Mechanical Engineering creative lead John Freidah to create video content showcasing the department's courses, students, and academic  activities. I contributed to filming, interviewing, editing and post production for multiple course videos and student profiles, which are featured on MechE's YouTube channel.

## Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution
### Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Fellow
Jun 2018 - Aug 2018 (3 months) | Woods Hole, MA
Through this summer fellowship, focused on sustainable fluid dynamics, I performed a systematic experimental study on the role of background rotation on the dynamics of turbulent fountains and jets.

Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)
Instructor
Jun 2017 - Aug 2017 (3 months) | Cambridge, MA
I served as a graduate instructor in the mechanical engineering track for the
women's technology program (WTP), a summer outreach program aimed at
introducing basic concepts in mechanical engineering to rising high school
seniors. I contributed to lesson plans and delivered lectures with interactive,
hands-on demos.
The George Washington University
Undergraduate Research Assistant
May 2012 - May 2015 (3 years, 1 month) | Washington, DC
I designed and performed experiments investigating physical processes during
the final stage of labor and delivery. In particular, I studied the role of amniotic fluid
properties in force transfer from the uterus to fetus during labor, including the
influence of fetal lie (position). This work was conducted in the Leftwich Lab in the
GW School of Engineering and Applied Science.
Harvard University
Visiting Undergraduate Research Assistant
Jun 2014 - Aug 2014 (3 months) | Cambridge, MA
I conducted experiments studying the relationship between mechanical properties
(flexural stiffness), unsteady motion, and propulsive efficiency of hydrofoils in a
circulating flow tank. In particular, we were focused on the role of unsteady
'perturbations' to foil motion pathways. This work was a collaboration between
Lauder Laboratory (Harvard University) and Leftwich Lab (GW), conducted at
Lauder Lab.
