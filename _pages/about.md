I am a PhD candidate whose research integrates analytical science, solid mechanics, and environmental chemistry to investigate microplastics, which pose a serious and growing threat to the health of our planet. Through my studies in mechanical and biomedical engineering, I also possesses background knowledge in fluid mechanics, heat and mass transfer, and biology.

I am passionate about applying my skills to find sustainable solutions to the worldâ€™s biggest challenges, and I am seeking a job that will give me opportunities to grow as a critical thinker, expand my data science skills, and contribute to the health of people and planet.
