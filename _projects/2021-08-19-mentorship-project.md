MechE ENGAGE (Empowering New Grads to Achieve Graduate Excellence) is a mentorship program for incoming graduate students from traditionally underserved populations. The program aims to foster trusting relationships, build networks, and equip students with the skills to thrive in graduate study. I led program design and assisted with logistics over three program implementations. As of 2023, the program continues with new student
leadership.

My presentation about it at NCORE is available here: <a href="/pdfs/NCORE_2022_Session_2219_MechE_ENGAGE.pdf" target="_blank">NCORE_2022_Session_2219_MechE_ENGAGE.pdf</a>
