MechE ENGAGE (Empowering New Grads to Achieve Graduate Excellence) is a mentorship program for incoming graduate students from traditionally underserved populations. The program aims to foster trusting relationships, build networks, and equip students with the skills to thrive in graduate study. Andrea led program design and assisted with logistics over three program implementations. As of 2023, the program continues with new student
leadership.

Andrea also gave a presentation about the program's design at the NCORE 2022 conference.
